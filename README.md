 ## Input
 
 Immediately after program starts you'll see following:
 
 <p align = "center" >
      <img src = "data/start.png" width = 900 />
 </>
 
 Then need to enter 3 coefficients of square equation separating them with space symbols
 
 <p align = "center" >
      <img src = "data/input_picture.png" width = 900/>
 </>
 
 If you've entered symbols which are not numbers, it displays "Your input data contains invalid symbols".
 
  <p align = "center" >
      <img src = "data/char_error.png" width = 900/>
 </>
 
 If you've entered less than 3 numbers, it displays "Enter 3 numbers!".
 
  <p align = "center" >
      <img src = "data/less_than_3_picture.png" width = 900/>
 </>
 
 ## Output
 
 Program displays roots in following style:  
 Number of roots: number of roots  
 Root(s): root1, root2.  
 
 <p align = "center" >
      <img src = "data/output_picture.png" width = 900/>
 </>
